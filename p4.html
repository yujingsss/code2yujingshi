      Intial interface design and aesthetic choice. The goal of ‘Vision in Your Eyes’ is to make an experimental camera that allows users to   take photos that only show people’s eyes. The platform is either on a mobile device or a laptop.<br>
Eyes are parts of human bodies and also very important. We use them to observe the world but also observe ourselves. They are like a window that opens our vision. Human as social creatures need to build connections with other existences. And one of the ways to communicate is to look at others’ eyes.<br>
Many people are not confident about how their eyes look like and prefer not to take too much photos for themselves. And many people are also afraid of looking at others’ eyes.<br> 
This camera will only emphasize the eyes and display the captured image in a mono color, film textured style with grains and black points. Even though the camera emphasize the eyes part, but it presents the images in a less realistic and more bizarre way like old films so that it will lessen the users’ rejections of looking straight towards someone’s or their own eyes.
